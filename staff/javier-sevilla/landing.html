    <p>There are many good reasons to create a blog.</p>    
    <p>You may want to practice your writing, create a following, establish your brand or use blogging as a marketing tool to increase site traffic. It’s also a great way to connect with like-minded people.</p>
    <p>How do you choose the site to build your blog on?</p>
    <p>There’s a wide choice of blogging platforms. The more choices there are, the harder it is to make up your mind.</p>
    <p>To help you choose the right blogging platform for yourself, we will first talk about what to look for in a blogging solution. After that, we’ll examine the pros and cons of the 10 best blog sites.</p>
    <p>Ready? Let’s get started…</p>
    <h2>How to Choose The Best Blogging Platform</h2>
    <p>For making a decision, it helps to know what you are looking for. As they say – if you don’t know where you are going, every way is the right way. Below are some categories to judge the candidates by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Costs – an indispensable consideration. It’s not only important that your blogging platform of choice fits within your budget but what you also get for your money. A free offer is worth nothing if it doesn’t do what you need.</li>
        <li>Beginner-friendliness – Beginners need a blogging solution that is easy to set up, manage, and doesn’t need coding skills to run. They also have to be able to find support when they run into trouble.</li>
        <li>Features and extendability – Over time, your needs and requirements for your site will change. You might want to modify or overhaul the design, add features, or make other drastic changes. A good blogging platform needs to be able to accommodate that.</li>
        <li>Maintenance – How much hands-on work does your blogging solution need? Does it take care of most of the activities and features for you, or do you have to do everything by hand? This will have a serious impact on your workflow.</li>
        <li>Monetization options – Many people start a blog or website to eventually earn money with it. If that is your objective as well, you better choose a platform that enables you to do that in a way that works for you.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The weighing of the factors above will be different depending on your skills, goals, and requirements. Keep them in mind while we compare the best blogging platforms out there.</p>
